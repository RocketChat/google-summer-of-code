### 💡 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Detection Assistant

👥 **Mentor(s):** Aman Negi

📢 **Communication Channel:** [idea-Frequently-Asked-Questions-Detection-Assistant](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/idea-Frequently-Asked-Questions-Detection-Assistant)

💬 **Description:**  

New contributors to open source often ask very similar questions.  Answering similar questions repeatedly can be a tiring and tedious task for maintainers (or mentors).  

This LLM powered assistant will solve the problem by:

1. monitoring Github webhooks or a set of specified Rocket.Chat channels for questions
1. determine if the incoming question is similar to one in a set of configured FAQ
1. if a match is found, do one of the following configurable action:
      1.  notify one or more configured users of the incoming question
      1.  notify one or more configured users of the incoming question via DM, providing a summarized answer as a suggestion 
      1.  notify one or more configured downstream LLM driven agents
      1.  same as ii., but provide the capability for the notified users to "approve" the automated reply of the summarized answer; some final editing before reply should be possible
      1.  answer the incoming question with a summarized answer; then notify one of the configured users in DM

Considerations:
- the assistant must be designed to be 100% fail safe; it should never answer unrelated question or answer with hallucinations (nor answer with harmful content)
- the assistant should be designed to be functional in all FAQ/templated answers/Quick-reply situations, increasing its utility
- this project will involve very clever prompting and optimized prompt chaining (instead of tedious volumous Typescript code) 

💪 **Desired Skills:**  

- Rocket.Chat Apps Development (Typescript)
- Github/Gitlab webhooks development
- Advanced prompt engineering
- Passion for creating LLM driven assistive applications

🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**  

A useful assistant in many automated public group chat/forum context with configurable abilities to help in handling frequently asked questions.

### 💡Server Setup Agent

👥 **Mentor(s):** Aditya Singh

📢 **Communication Channel:** [idea-Server-Setup-Agent](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/idea-Server-Setup-Agent)

💬 **Description:**  

As an administrator setting up a production Rocket.Chat server, one is typically required to create user accounts, create and assign roles, create default channels, possibly starting threads, starting discussions and populating with initial messages. 

These sort of tedious tasks are also often required in the testing and quality assurrance  of Rocket.Chat or Rocket.Chat related apps/projects.  Furthermore, they are also required in many demo and training situations.

This project is a Setup Agent App that  automates all of the above based on either a series of slash commands or by loading an automated script. 

The script should conform to an easy to learn, intuitive and simple DSL (Domain Specific Langauge) of the contributor's design. 

The language needs to incorporate basic variables, and be able to handle simple counted loops.  Conditionals and conditional loops are nice to have.  

The agent should be tested to handle very large scripts that may involve the creation of thousands of objects and messages.  

DSL will be checked for LLM-generation suitability; although AI generation of the script is outside the scope of this project.


💪 **Desired Skills:**  

- Interest in DSL and AST (Domain Specific Language and Abstract Syntax Trees)
- Rocket.Chat Apps development (Typescript) 
- Familiarity with Rocket.Chat's REST APIs

🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**  

A Rocket.Chat App "agent" that can help setup servers (or for QA or demo or training) by executing an automated script.

📢 **Communication Channel:** [idea-Natural-Language-Bridge-to-Legacy-Email](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/idea-Natural-Language-Bridge-to-Legacy-Email)

💬 **Description:**  

Messaging systems such as Rocket.Chat were supposed to be replacing legacy email for communications and collaboration since the early nineteen nineties.   But even after three decades of evolution and struggle, half the world still hangs onto legacy email worldwide despite most have grown up with SMS and asynchronous messaging.

This project bridges the great divide most naturally with a Rocket.Chat App that responds to natural language instructions and brings the legacy email world right into every Rocket.Chat conversation for every user. 

The app will respond to command such as:

```
/xuebot summarize this thread and send it as email to my boss who refuses to use chat
```

OR:

```
/xuebot post in the channel for everyone the budget for 2025 email pdf received between 11/1/2024 and 12/24/2024
```

Details:

You will be using the function calling/tools capabilities of modern LLMs, plus some extremely clever prompting, as well as some hardcore Typescript coding to realize this app.

The agent must be able to perform the following **reliably** as a minimum:

* summarize thread/channel/discussion and send as email to specified recipient(s)
* search emails by date range and keywords and present in-channel as message and/or extract attachment and upload to channel
* report on daily email statistics
* secured per-user email connection over TLS 

💪 **Desired Skills:**  

* Rocket.Chat Apps (Typescript) Development
* Advanced prompt engineering skills
* Familiarity with Gmail and other mail provider APIs
* Familiarity with LLM function calling / tools capabilities

### Server Guide Agent 

👥 **Mentor(s):** Gabriel Casals, Jeffery Yu

📢 **Communication Channel:** [idea-Server-Guide-AI-Agent](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/idea-Server-Guide-AI-Agent)

💬 **Description:**

As a new user joins a Rocket.Chat server there is not much guidance on what to do or where to go.   

Right now, the only mechanism is a passive landing page that may display resources for each grouping (persona) of users. 

For example, on the open.rocket.chat server, a user may be: 

* A Rocket.Chat server administrators looking to connect with other administrators
* An end-user of Rocket.Chat looking to resolve problem or receive support information. 
* A new community contributor looking for Google Summer of Code program information
* others

Each one of these personas demand different style of conversation and would need to know about/join different sets of channels and other resources.

Details:

The project aims to replace the boring "easy to miss, difficult to understand" landing page, with an AI guide agent.   This agent should start a conversation with the new user and then using modern LLM's discrimination/classification ability to positively identify the persona (users grouping/ sub-communities on a server) that the new user belongs to.   The agent should continue to tune the conversation to the lingo-preferred of that persona, and finally guide the user to all the resources and channels available for that persona.  This agent must be configurable (via Rocket.Chat Apps configuration) to handle any arbitrary persona and related resources set.

Recommended Approach: 

The agent should be able to add (and join) the appropriate channel for the new user, after confirming the action with the new user.  A default/catch-all persona should be used to precisely scoped the project and ensure the LLM can converge onto a useful result. Since direct user input will be passed to the LLM for analysis, the agent MUST make sure that there is no prompt-injection possibility. Safety of server operation must be taken into account as this agent has ability to change the state of the server permanently.

💪 **Desired Skills:**

- Experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems
- Rocket.Chat Apps Engine (TypeScript)  
- Rocket.Chat messaging APIs
- Advanced prompt engineering skills   
- Experience with tools/function-calling capabilities of modern LLMs
- Understanding of how to implement "safety first" when creating AI apps that may permanently change the state of a production system

🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**

An AI Agent that will help to onboard new users.

⏳ **Project Duration:** 175 hours (Medium)

📢 **Communication Channel:** [idea-Perfect-AI-Docs-Assistant-App](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/idea-Perfect-AI-Docs-Assistant-App)

💬 **Description:**  

This project aims to build a Rocket.Chat App that provides a **natural language interface** for querying Rocket.Chat Docs (docs.rocket.chat). Instead of manually searching for answers, users can simply ask the app, and it will return a **perfect, relevant response** extracted and summarized from the documentation.

For the very small dataset that we are working with, we aim to tune and optimize the well-known RAG agentic workflow for our specific purpose; ideally producing  **an optimized and perfect Ask the Docs Assistant** for this subset of the Rocket.Chat documentation.
 
Consider possibly:  

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agentic workflow** the AI/ML design pattern we're all familiar with   
- **Local embedding model** needs to run in memory/CPU for maximum efficiency
- **In-memory vector store** run in the client with no persistence, subject of further optimization (chunking, match-selection, metadata) to tune for _perfect results_
- **Context-aware follow-up responses** not required but nice to have

💪 **Desired Skills:**  

- Rocket.Chat Apps Engine (TypeScript)  
- Modern agentic workflows (including classic-RAG)
- Web Storage & IndexedDB (for caching, if needed)
- Intermediate prompt engineering 
- Keen interest in contemporary applications of LLMs

🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**  

* generation/creation of a perfect validation dataset, consisting of (1500, 5000, 10000) queriies and corresponding answer, that will be used in the benchmark/validation of the final assistant
* a fine-tuned compact LLM to be used in the last stage of the RAG agentic workflow (fine-tuned minimally on the dataset above)
* the perfect "ask the docs assistant" for our small dataset, running mostly on the client without heavy compute overhead, ideally scoring 90% plus on the benchmark 

_(we like to thank our early community for helping us to fine-tune this set of deliverables)_

### 📅  Message Timestamp Date Picker Components

👥 **Mentor(s):** [Martin Schoeler](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/martin.schoeler)

📢 **Communication Channel:** [idea-Message-Timestamp-Date-Picker-Components](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/idea-Message-Timestamp-Date-Picker-Components)

💬 **Description:**
Currently Rocket.Chat has a feature that allows users to send timestamps on messages, but not in an intuitive way. To send a timestamp you need to manually write it down with the correct date code. For example `<t:1732557600:t>`.
This feature was added for Rocket.Chat Apps engine, but users can benefit from this too. The objective of this project is to create a new `MessageToolBar` item that displays a calendar and let the users select the date and time they would like to share, both in the desktop app and mobile apps.

Some examples of the usage of the timestamp feature (you can test them today on the open.rocket.chat server!)

Pattern: <t:{timestamp}:?{format}>

- {timestamp} is a Unix timestamp
- {format} is an optional parameter that can be used to customize the date and time format.

**Formats**

| Format | Description               | Example                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `t`    | Short time                | 12:00 AM                                |
| `T`    | Long time                 | 12:00:00 AM                             |
| `d`    | Short date                | 12/31/2020                              |
| `D`    | Long date                 | Thursday, December 31, 2020             |
| `f`    | Full date and time        | Thursday, December 31, 2020 12:00 AM    |
| `F`    | Full date and time (long) | Thursday, December 31, 2020 12:00:00 AM |
| `R`    | Relative time             | 1 year ago                              |

The creation of tests for the new component is also expected, both end to end and unit if applicable.

💪 **Desired Skills:** React, Typescript, React Native

🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:** A new component on the `MessageToolBar` that allows users to add timestamps to their messages, both in desktop and mobile.

📢 **Communication Channel:** [idea-Private-Teams-and-Private-Channels-Adminitration-Improvements](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/idea-Private-Teams-and-Private-Channels-Adminitration-Improvements)

💬 **Description:**  

While it is possible to create private team and private channels in Rocket.Chat, the ability for the server's administrator to perform administrative tasks on them are currently very limited  (unless the server admin is part of the private channel or private team).  This was done by the original "team designer" to afford some local privacy for these these users.

This project aims to improve this situation by adding the ability for the server administrator to (optionally) override  (via configuration on admin panel) to directly access and administer private team and private channels.

This should include minimally the following abilities:

* add/remove users in private channels
* assign and change the roles of private channel users
* add/remove/rename private team channels
* add/remove/modify the members of private teams
* assign and change the roles of private team users  
* access private channels and private teams in the Directory
