### GitHub Pull request reminders app

**Mentors:** Murtaza Patrawala, Samad Khan

**Description:**\
Have you ever faced challenges keeping track of your pull request reviews as a student? This is a common problem faced by many development teams. That's why we propose developing a pull request reminder app for [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) as a part of the Google Summer of Code program. For now, we’re isolating the scope of this project to GitHub.

The app's goal will be to provide regular reminders and updates to keep the review process moving and help ensure that pull requests are being reviewed and discussed in a timely manner. This project will be built on top of [this existing GitHub App](https://github.com/RocketChat/Apps.Github22) which already has a bunch of boilerplate code to deal with authentications and GitHub APIs.

One approach to solving the issue of pending pull requests is to create a separate Rocket.Chat channels for each pull request (This is a proven strategy organizations already use on Slack. Check [here](https://axolo.co/blog/p/utlimate-slack-pull-request-reminder-bot) for more info). This way, all relevant stakeholders can be added to the channel, including the author of the pull request, the reviewers, and any other team members who need to be informed about the status of the review.

The Rocket.Chat channels can serve as a dedicated space for discussion and collaboration around each pull request. Users can receive notifications about updates to the pull request, such as new comments or changes to the code. This helps keep everyone informed and ensures the review process stays on track.

Example text message for Rocket.Chat channel:

* "🔔 Attention reviewers! This pull request has been pending for \[number] days now. Let's make sure to give it the attention it deserves and keep the review process moving forward 🚀"

In addition, the users can also opt-in to receive a direct message from the bot at the start of their workday, with a comprehensive list of all the reviews that need his/her attention.

Example DM text messages:

1. "👀 Time to give those pull requests some love! You've got \[number] pending review(s) waiting for you. Don't keep your fellow developers waiting 😊"
2. "🔔 Don't let those pull requests get forgotten! You've got \[number] waiting for your review. Let's get to work 💻"
3. "🚀 It's time to move those pull requests forward! You've got \[number] waiting for your review. Give them the green light 💚"

By using Rocket.Chat channels to manage the review process, teams can improve the visibility of their pull requests and ensure that they are being reviewed and discussed in a timely manner.

PS: For more inspiration on how to solve this issue, please refer to some of these solutions on other platforms.

* [Pull Remind](https://www.producthunt.com/products/pull-reminders)

### Introduce Captcha to Livechat Widget

**Mentors:** Murtaza Patrawala, Kevin Aleman

**Description:**\
RocketChat is a popular open-source communication platform, but it is not uncommon for spammers to take advantage of its live chat widget to send unwanted messages. To mitigate this issue, a CAPTCHA solution should be implemented in the live chat widget. This project aims to integrate a CAPTCHA mechanism in RocketChat's live chat widget to prevent spam messages from being sent.

The solution should allow users to prove that they are human by completing a simple CAPTCHA task before sending a message. This will help to reduce the number of spam messages and improve the overall user experience.

Key Deliverables:

* Integration of a CAPTCHA solution in RocketChat's live chat widget
* A comprehensive testing suite to ensure that the CAPTCHA is working as expected
* A user guide to help users understand how to use the new CAPTCHA feature in the live chat widget

Note: The CAPTCHA solution should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, and should not negatively impact the user experience.

**Desirable Skills:** React (Mid-level); Familiar with [Rocket.Chat Livechat](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/tree/develop/packages/livechat)

### Open source Metaverse integration (mozilla hubs / third room)

**Mentors:**  Hugo Costa,  Sing Li

**Description:**\
One very popular interpretation of the "Metaverse" is group interactions within a real-time rendered 3D Virtual Reality world. [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) has been the leading open source project in this space for the **last decade**. Due to the limitation (and cost) of today's technology, however, hub has always had limited scalability. Rooms can contain 20 to 30 attendees. Another similar technology proof of concept has emerged recently in [Third Room](https://github.com/matrix-org/thirdroom). While Rocket.Chat as a collaboration platform has re-architectured to handle millions of users - and through federation, the world; we have also implemented Team Channels to deal with very large communities wanting autonomous control over their membership. This project is to create a rational integration between Mozilla Hubs (and/or Third Room) and Rocket.Chat team channel - enabling a pragmatic version of "the metaverse" to be built organically.\
\
We welcome original proposals at different levels of integration. It can be a direct extension of core, an external bridge, a link preview-extension, or even a Rocket.Chat App.\\

**Desired Skills:**

ReactJS, TypeScript, MeteorJS. A thorough understanding of how Rocket.Chat core works. Knowledge of Rocket.Chat Apps development. Passion for improving human communications and collaboration.

**Goals/Deliverables:**\
Working integration of Mozilla Hubs rooms within Rocket.Chat Team Channels in a rational and usable context.

### Penetration Tests and Potential Vulnerabilities Fixes

**Mentor(s):** Igor Rincon

**Description:**\
Security is critical to any open source project that works with user data over the web, and Rocket.chat recognizes the importance of safeguarding confidential information. Web application security and penetration testing involve identifying potential vulnerabilities, evaluating risks, conducting tests, and implementing countermeasures to prevent unauthorized access.\
\
The focus of the project is going to be conducting security research on the Rocket.chat open-source project and identifying and repairing specific security vulnerabilities that will be found.\
\
For this project, the automated and manual security tests, including static analysis, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning will be maintained in the[ Rocket.Chat open source pentest repository](https://github.com/RocketChat/pentests).\
\
In addition, the proposal should include some continuous integration tools to prevent the introduction of new vulnerabilities.\
\
Together, these tests and tools will allow us to deliver a collaboration platform that is secure and reliable for use by all our community users.

#### Expected Deliverables:

* Automated and Manual security tests, including static analysis, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning.
* Recommend (and possibly implement) fixes and retesting of the system to ensure that vulnerabilities are resolved.
* creation and/or integration of continuous integration tools to prevent the introduction of new vulnerabilities.
* A detailed risk assessment report, including a prioritized list of vulnerabilities and recommended fixes (these may need to be submitted in private initially until time for public disclosure)
* Possible addition -- Tools to enable Github Recon, also known as Github footprinting. It is a process where researchers use Github to collect information about an organization's internal infrastructure, security configurations, codebase, tools, and policies. This is achieved by closely examining public repositories, reviewing organization accounts, commits, and pull requests, and searching for any useful pieces of information that could help better understand the target. The process involves identifying key personnel within an organization and looking into their contributions and activities on Github. These can provide insight into the type of work they may be involved in, tools and technologies they use, and any potential security risks or misconfigurations they may have unintentionally leaked onto the public platform.

### Full-stack Components Framework for Community Builders

**Mentors:** TBD

**Description:**\
Full-stack component is the holy grail of software componentization. Imagine building a fully functional customized web portal in minutes by dragging and dropping full-stack components. Each component not only contains interactive UI, but also associated mid-tier and server-side/severless behaviours as well as parameterizations. Unfortunately the state of our current software art is not quite there yet. The next best thing is actually which solves the same problem but at a page level and not at the component-within-the-page level.\
\
RC4Community is a specialized componentized framework for community builders to rapidly create fully functional community portal. It was designed to work with a full-stack component framework since day one - but had to use Next.js instead.

This project involves the introduction of the missing architectural, build workflow, and packaging technology to enable full-stack components within the RC4Community context.
