For timeline, see [Official Google Summer of Code 2026](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) Timeline for more details.

Almost anyone in the world [over 18 years of age](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/11/expanding-google-summer-of-code-in-2022.html) who loves coding and wants to explore the incredible world of open source can join us as a GSoC 2026 contributor.

Most exciting news for the 2026 season is continued focus on ML/AI projects, and the continued support for a small project size with a 90 hours duration; allowing participation from those who can only devote part of their summer to exploring open source.

For details and rules of Google Summer of Code 2026, please see the [GSoC 2026 Official Website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). For timeline, see [Official Google Summer of Code 2026 Timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) for more details.

If you intend to use AI to assist you in the creation of your project proposal, please be aware that we will not be accepting any proposals that is directly created by an LLM or Agentic AI tooling.   The proposal must be crafted by you personally (OK to use AI for research, translation, and so on) and you must be ready to defend every line of its content when/if we contact you for a meeting.  You should also be engaged within our community (active on our [Google Summer of Code 2026 Team ](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/opensource2026), attend our weekly tea time, take our live workshops, and so on) and have auditable Github activity to increase the probability of your proposal being considered for GSoC 2026.

## 📂 Project Ideas   

(This list is going through some rapid changes as we work with mentors to fully flesh out the project ideas.)


### 💡 High-Performance Message Parser Rewrite

👥 **Mentor(s):** Matheus Cardoso  
📢 **Communication Channel:** Rocket.Chat Contributors Workspace

💬 **Description:**
The current Rocket.Chat [message parser](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/tree/develop/packages/message-parser) relies on [PeggyJS](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy) (formerly [PEG.js](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs)). While effective, the generated parser creates performance bottlenecks and adds significant bundle size overhead.
The goal of this project is to replace the PeggyJS-generated parser with a highly optimized, hand-written TypeScript implementation (or using a toolkit like [Chevrotain](https://github.com/Chevrotain/chevrotain). The new implementation must produce the exact same Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure as the current one but with a focus on **speed**, **type safety**, and **modularity**.

💪 **Desired Skills:**

* TypeScript
* Algorithms & Data Structures (Context-Free Grammars, Recursive Descent)
* Performance Profiling & Benchmarking
* Property-based Testing (e.g., fast-check)

🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**

* **Core Implementation:** A functional, drop-in replacement parser in pure TypeScript.
* **100% Parity:** Pass all existing unit tests (`message-parser/tests/*.test.ts`) to guarantee backward compatibility.
* **Robustness:** Implement **Fuzz Testing** (property-based testing) to ensure the parser handles edge cases and malformed inputs without crashing.
* **Performance:** Create a benchmark suite demonstrating significant improvements in **ops/sec** and a reduction in **bundle size**.

### 💡 AI Rocket.Chat Apps Generator 

👥 **Mentor(s):**   Dnouv    
📢 **Communication Channel:**   Rocket.Chat Contributors Workspace   

💬 **Description:**  
This is a set of extension (or a fork) of open source `gemini-cli` that will facilitate anyone to create/generate their own  Rocket.Chat app with ease. 

The tool must have built-in internal knowledge of the architecture of a Rocket.Chat App, how to build and test an App,  and how to generate ALL the elements that an App can use to interface with the Apps Engine/server (bridged APIs, web hooks, persistence, per-user state management and so on).     

The tool should also be able to generate and maintain tests for the created App.

💪 **Desired Skills:**  
- Experience with modern code generation cli (Claude Code, OpenCode, OpenAI Codex, gemini-cli and so on )  
— A passion for creating tooling for AI coding  
— Familiarity with Rocket.Chat App creation and Apps Engine operation
- TypeScript development 
— gemini-cli architecture and extension mechanisms 
— Prompt engineering

🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**  
A very easy to use and understand CLI tool that anyone can use to create, test, and deploy their own custom Rocket.Chat apps.

### 💡 Rocket.Chat Code Analyzer: agentic inference context reduction mechanics 
👥 **Mentor(s):**   William Liu  
📢 **Communication Channel:**   Rocket.Chat Contributors Workspace   

💬 **Description:**  
Most production codebases are stored in huge revision control repositories (similar to Rocket.Chat) and  are often monorepos that combines the source code of a large number of related subprojects.  

When AI agentic tooling is unleashed on these huge code repositories, it quickly reveals the primitive and wasteful (unoptimized) nature of early tools.    Because LLM inferences are being performed inside a loop where the context of the queries are being built; and the context is constantly increasing in size, query after query.    

This means that repositories as large as Rocket.Chat is often out of reach (of the token/AI-inference budget) for many open source developers.  Even though some AI service providers offer per-session caching and compression (llmlinqua and so on), these are O(n) optimizations that have only nominal impact on the overall project/session cost when large repositories are involved.  

This project explores and implements a class of “domain specific context reduction mechanisms” that can  have exponential impact when working with large code repositories.  These scoping mechanisms are specific to (works only with)  the domain of “code analysis/generation”.  

The project’s code will be an extension or fork of `gemini-cli`,  with the context reduction mechanism added.   It will enable users of `gemini-cli`  to work with (analyze, or generate code based on ) the (known to be huge) Rocket.Chat’s monorepo, all within the budget of the “free tier” inference currently offered by Google.       
Ideally, the mechanics should be implemented in a re-usable manner, extending its utility to other large codebases and the contributor can contribute it back upstream to `gemini-cli`. 

💪 **Desired Skills:**   
— A passion for innovations on open source tooling for the age of open source AI  (vibe) coding 
- Experience with modern code generation cli - Claude Code, OpenCode, OpenAI Codex, gemini-cli and so on
- Intimate understanding of how  gemini-cli works  — Familiarity with Rocket.Chat’s codebase in our monorepo
- TypeScript development — Coding with gemini-cli extension mechanisms  — Prompt engineering — Theoretical understanding of agentic systems and LLM inference 

🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**   
Tooling that enables open source AI developers to work with huge production code repositories, within industry provider’s free-tier limits; opening access of these great tools to an exponentially larger population of users.
