### 💡 Extended LLM Prompt Editor/Explorer

👥 **Mentor(s):** Shubham Bhardwaj

💬 **Description:**

A prompt editor is the quintessential development tool for any  AI/ML prompt engineer.   With ever-increasing number of Rocket.Chat users experimenting and developing with open source LLMs, it is important to have a great prompt editor at their disposal.  This project includes the creation of a fully featured prompt editor as a Rocket.Chat app.   This editor should enable free conversation, by any designated/configured Rocket.Chat user, to chat with any open source LLMs (Mistral,  Llama 2,  Phi, and so on), and the ability to save (and manage - delete etc)  all conversation history.   It should also enable a Rocket.Chat users to "share" the prompt(s) to external applications.   Initial implementation should be for the RC Web App (and Electron).  

💪 **Desired Skills:**  Rocket.Chat Apps development.  LLM prompt editor dev experience.

🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:** Rocket.Chat App empowering users to converse freely with open source LLMs and save the conversations.  The app must allow management of these prompts by the user, including deletion, renaming, and sharing of the prompt content via the clipboard or into the chat stream as a message.

In 2024, we want to extend these tours to include graphical diagrams and flow charts.  

Paths to be documented and graphically enhanced for 2024 include these areas:

* How a message is sent
* How to create an endpoint
* How to add a new service
* How to create a DB model
* How to use DB models
* How services interact between them
* How to build a lib
* How to navigate monorepo (where is everything, how's imported, etc)

We welcome any additional ideas you may have.
